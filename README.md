### üèÜ The Project:
#### Final project

The successful completion and validation of the final project demonstrated the practical application of data engineering principles and tools. This validation involved a thorough review and assessment by the Zoomcamp instructors, ensuring that all aspects of the project met the high standards set by the course.
